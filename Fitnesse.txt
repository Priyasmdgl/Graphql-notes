Acceptance testing:
-------------------
Framework used for acceptance testing is Fitnesse
acceptance testing takes place at the end user side
It is similar like black box testing.
for a valid input valid output will be received
download fitnesse jar from fitness download and run that from that path using java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p port

test page- contains the test cases
suite page- contains multiple test cases
static page- contains some additional informations which is given by the user

click on edit and give the name of the page in camel case and save it
then click the ? mark and again save it and it will be turned into a link
then add a test or suite page

Fixtures:
---------
fixture is the end product of our application
to create a fixture we need to write the coding logic with the same class name,variable name and method name which we created in fitnesse page

package CalculatorTest;

import fit.ColumnFixture;

public class Addition extends ColumnFixture{
  int num1;
  int num2;
  int result;
public int getNum1() {
	return num1;
}
public void setNum1(int num1) {
	this.num1 = num1;
}
public int getNum2() {
	return num2;
}
public void setNum2(int num2) {
	this.num2 = num2;
}
public int getResult() {
	return result;
}
public void setResult(int result) {
	this.result = result;
}
  
  public int add() {
	  result = num1+num2;
	  return result;
  }
}
create getters and setters for the declared variables by right click on the project and select source and generate getters and setters

add the fitnesse jar to the java project and extend column fixture in java class as public class Addition extends ColumnFixture
to create a link between our code and fitnesse we should add our code path to the fitnesse
right click on the project and select show in-> system explorer and go the bin folder and there will be the class file of our code
copy that path and paste it in fitnesse as !path C:\Users\HP\Selenium\Fitnesse\bin
then import the package 
|Import|
|CalculatorTest|

We can do api testing by fitnesse
